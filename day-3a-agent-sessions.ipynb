It's one of the most active and promising areas of AI in healthcare.\n\nHere are some of the key trends and recent types of developments you'll find in this space:\n\n**1. Accelerating Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **AI analyzing vast biological datasets:** This includes genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data to identify novel disease targets (e.g., specific proteins or pathways) that were previously unknown or difficult to find.\n*   **Predicting disease mechanisms:** AI can help researchers understand the complex biological pathways that lead to disease, pointing to better intervention points.\n*   **Example:** News often emerges about AI platforms that have identified a novel target for a specific cancer or neurodegenerative disease, leading to the initiation of new drug development programs.\n\n**2. Revolutionizing Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for novel molecule creation:** This is a major breakthrough. AI models (often based on deep learning techniques like generative adversarial networks or transformers) can \"design\" entirely new molecular structures with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, good absorption, low toxicity).\n*   **De novo drug design:** Instead of screening existing libraries, AI can create molecules from scratch.\n*   **Optimizing existing drug candidates:** AI can suggest modifications to existing compounds to improve their efficacy, reduce side effects, or enhance their pharmacokinetic properties.\n*   **Example:** You'll see reports of companies using AI to design millions of potential drug candidates for a given target in a matter of days or weeks, a process that would take years traditionally.\n\n**3. Enhancing Drug Screening and Pre-clinical Testing:**\n\n*   **Virtual screening:** AI can sift through massive chemical libraries much faster and more accurately than traditional methods, predicting which compounds are most likely to interact with a target.\n*   **Predicting drug efficacy and toxicity:** AI models can be trained on existing experimental data to predict how a new compound might perform in laboratory tests (in vitro) and animal studies (in vivo) before actual experiments are run.\n*   **Reducing experimental costs and time:** By accurately predicting outcomes, AI can significantly reduce the number of costly and time-consuming physical experiments required.\n*   **Example:** News might highlight AI being used to quickly identify promising compounds from a large library for a specific therapeutic area, saving millions in early-stage research.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Identifying new uses for old drugs:** AI can analyze drug-disease relationships, scientific literature, and patient data to discover that an already approved drug might be effective against a different condition. This significantly shortens the development timeline as safety data is already available.\n*   **Example:** There's ongoing interest in using AI to find existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat emerging infectious diseases or rare conditions.\n\n**5. Improving Clinical Trial Design and Patient Selection:**\n\n*   **Predicting patient response to drugs:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular drug, leading to more targeted and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Optimizing trial design:** AI can help design more efficient clinical trials by identifying optimal dosages, endpoints, and patient populations.\n*   **Example:** AI is being used to identify patients for trials based on complex genetic markers or imaging features, making trials more likely to succeed.\n\n**Key Companies and Areas to Watch:**\n\nMany companies, both startups and established pharmaceutical giants, are heavily invested in AI-driven drug discovery. Some of the leading players and areas of focus include:\n\n*   **AI-first drug discovery companies:** BenevolentAI, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Insilico Medicine, Atomwise, Exscientia.\n*   **Major pharmaceutical companies:** Eli Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis, and many others are partnering with AI firms or building their own internal AI capabilities.\n*   **Specific therapeutic areas:** Oncology, neuroscience (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), infectious diseases, and rare diseases are common areas where AI is making significant inroads.\n\n**Where to find \"latest\" news:**\n\nAs mentioned before, keeping up with the absolute latest requires checking specialized sources regularly. Look for announcements about:\n\n*   **New drug candidates entering clinical trials** that were discovered or designed using AI.\n*   **Partnerships** between AI companies and pharmaceutical firms.\n*   **Acquisitions** of AI drug discovery companies.\n*   **Breakthroughs** in AI model capabilities for specific biological problems.\n\nThe field is moving so fast that even news from a few months ago can feel somewhat dated. If you have a specific disease or type of drug you're interested in, I can try to provide more focused recent information!\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the **\"Revolutionizing Molecule Design and Optimization\"** aspect of AI in drug discovery. This is a truly groundbreaking area because it shifts drug discovery from largely empirical searching to more rational, AI-guided design.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this means and what the latest developments are:\n\n**The Core Idea: AI as a Molecular Architect**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved:\n\n1.  **Target Identification:** Figuring out what biological molecule (like a protein) is involved in a disease.\n2.  **Screening Libraries:** Testing hundreds of thousands or millions of existing chemical compounds to see if any bind to the target. This is a laborious and often serendipitous process.\n3.  **Optimization:** Taking promising \"hits\" from screening and making small chemical modifications to improve their properties (efficacy, safety, how they're absorbed by the body). This is also largely trial-and-error based.\n\nAI is revolutionizing steps 2 and 3 by acting as an intelligent designer:\n\n**Key AI Technologies and Approaches:**\n\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Think of GANs as a system with two competing neural networks:\n    *   **Generator:** Tries to create new, plausible drug-like molecules.\n    *   **Discriminator:** Tries to tell whether a molecule is real or generated.\n    *   Through this competition, the Generator gets progressively better at creating molecules that not only look like real drugs but also have desired properties.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs can learn a compressed \"latent space\" representation of molecules. By manipulating points in this latent space, researchers can generate new molecules with specific characteristics.\n*   **Transformer Networks (like those used in language models):** These are powerful for understanding sequential data. Molecules can be represented as sequences of chemical notations (like SMILES strings). Transformers can learn the \"grammar\" of molecular structures and generate new ones that follow these rules.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used to guide the generative process. The AI agent \"explores\" different molecular designs, and is \"rewarded\" if the generated molecule meets specific criteria (e.g., high binding affinity, good solubility).\n\n**What's New and Exciting in This Area?**\n\n1.  **De Novo Design of Novel Chemical Entities (NCEs):**\n    *   **What it is:** AI is not just modifying existing molecules; it's creating entirely new molecular scaffolds and structures that may not have been conceived by human chemists.\n    *   **Latest advancements:** Researchers are achieving higher success rates in generating molecules that are not only novel but also possess good drug-likeness properties and are synthetically feasible (meaning chemists can actually make them in the lab).\n    *   **Example:** Companies are announcing that their AI has designed the first molecule for a specific target that is entering human trials, showcasing the speed from concept to clinic.\n\n2.  **Multi-Objective Optimization:**\n    *   **What it is:** Drugs need to be good at many things simultaneously: binding to the target, being absorbed, distributed, metabolized, excreted (ADME properties), and avoiding toxicity. Traditional methods struggle to balance these.\n    *   **Latest advancements:** AI models are getting much better at optimizing for multiple properties at once. They can generate molecules that are, for example, potent inhibitors of a target, have good oral bioavailability, and are unlikely to cause liver damage – all in one design cycle.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might generate a candidate that is designed to be less likely to interact with \"off-target\" proteins, thereby reducing potential side effects.\n\n3.  **Predicting Synthesizability:**\n    *   **What it is:** A beautifully designed molecule is useless if it's impossible or extremely difficult to synthesize in a lab.\n    *   **Latest advancements:** AI models are being developed that can not only design molecules but also predict the most efficient synthetic route for making them, or even flag molecules that are likely to be very hard to synthesize. This bridges the gap between computational design and practical chemistry.\n    *   **Example:** A drug discovery platform might present a list of 10 promising molecules along with a step-by-step synthesis plan for each.\n\n4.  **Integrating with Experimental Feedback Loops:**\n    *   **What it is:** The most advanced systems are not just designing in a vacuum. They are designed to learn from experimental results.\n    *   **Latest advancements:** AI systems can receive feedback from high-throughput screening or synthesis results, allowing them to refine their design strategies and generate better molecules in subsequent iterations. This creates a powerful, closed-loop system.\n    *   **Example:** If the first AI-designed molecule doesn't bind as strongly as predicted, the AI learns from this discrepancy and generates new molecules that better match the experimental outcome.\n\n**Impact and Future:**\n\nThis ability to rationally design molecules from scratch, optimized for multiple properties, is drastically shortening the time and reducing the cost of the early stages of drug discovery. It's moving us closer to a future where personalized medicines or treatments for rare diseases can be designed on demand, rather than relying on lengthy and often unsuccessful traditional methods.\n\nKeep an eye out for announcements about companies using AI for the \"design\" phase, especially when they mention *de novo* design or multi-objective optimization leading to molecules entering pre-clinical or clinical studies.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the exciting field of **AI-driven molecule design and optimization**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
